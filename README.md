# Transport Data Analysis

This repository contains analysis workflows for ticket validation data in a public transport system.
The goal is to understand demand patterns, station usage, and operational anomalies.

## What you will find here
- Data cleaning and preparation (Python / pandas)
- Time-based aggregation (hourly ranges)
- Station-level breakdown
- Basic anomaly exploration (outliers, unusual patterns)

## Project structure
- `notebooks/`: analysis notebooks
- `data/`: sample or anonymized datasets used for demonstration
- `outputs/`: exported tables and figures

## Notes on data
To protect operational confidentiality, the dataset provided here is anonymized and simplified.
The analysis logic remains representative of real operational use cases.
